                    <h3> About Me </h3>
                    <p>As a millennial, my first real experience with coding happened becuase of MySpace. I
                        would spend
                        <em>hours</em> buidling my homepage; organizing my top 8 friends, adding little hearts
                        to my
                        tag, plugging in links to play my favorite song when you clicked into my page.. it was
                        then that
                        I realize my love for creating beautiful webpages.
                    </p>
                    <p>I joined <a href="https://www.thinkful.com.html">Thinkful</a> after witnessing my
                        youngest sister
                        graduate from the program. It was apparent that she was instilled with all the
                        knowledge she
                        needed to start a new career. Watching her succeed inspired me to make the leap and
                        begin my
                        journey in Software Engineering. I havent looked back since.</p>
                    <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer I would be honored to join your team. </p>
